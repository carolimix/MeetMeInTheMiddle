# Meet Me in the Middle

## Overview

"Meet Me in the Middle" is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding a convenient and equitable meeting point between two addresses in a city. Living in a bustling urban environment like Berlin, the struggle to find a central meetup spot for friends living in different areas inspired the creation of this project.

## Features

- **Address Input:** Users can input two addresses to determine their starting points.
- **Category Selection:** Users can select a category (e.g., cafe, park, museum) for their meeting point, adding a personalized touch to the meetup location.
- **Map Visualization:** Utilizes MapTiler SDK for an interactive and dynamic map display, enhancing user experience.
- **Geocoding API Integration:** Leverages the MapTiler Geocoding API to convert addresses into precise geographical coordinates for accurate mapping.
- **Midpoint Calculation:** The application calculates the midpoint between the two entered addresses, providing a fair and central location for both parties.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Directs users to a Google Maps search with recommendations near the calculated midpoint, further facilitating the planning process.

## Technology Stack

- **JavaScript:** Core language for dynamic and interactive web functionality.
- **MapTiler SDK:** JavaScript library for mapping features and dynamic map visualization.
- **MapTiler Geocoding API:** Converts addresses into geographical coordinates for accurate mapping.
